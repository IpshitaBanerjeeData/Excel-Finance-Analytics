**Atlịq Hardwares Financial Performance Analysis (FY 2019-2021)**
**Project Overview**

This project analyzes the financial performance of Atlịq Hardwares, focusing on profitability metrics across global markets and sub-zones over a three-year period (Fiscal Years 2019, 2020, and 2021). The primary goal was to identify top-performing markets, track Gross Margin (GM%) stability, and provide data-backed insights for strategic business planning.

**Data Sources**

The analysis utilized internal sales and P&L (Profit & Loss) data, which included:
Market P&L Data (FY 2021): Detailed figures for Net Sales, COGS (Cost of Goods Sold), Gross Margin (Value), and Gross Margin Percentage (GM%) for 23 global markets.
Quarterly GM% Data (FY 2019 - 2021): Time-series data tracking quarterly GM% across 5 major sub-zones (ANZ, India, NA, NE, ROA, SE) to assess trends and stability over time.

**Analysis & Key Insights**
The analysis involved calculating, comparing, and trending profitability metrics to uncover performance drivers.

**1.** FY 2021 Market Profitability
1. Top GM% Performers: New Zealand ($48.2), Japan ($46.5%), and United Kingdom ($45.1%) showcased exceptionally strong profitability relative to their sales, suggesting effective cost management or high-value product sales.
2. Highest Volume/Value: India ($161.26M Net Sales, $51.6M Gross Margin) was the largest market by both sales and absolute margin value, despite having a moderate GM% 32.0%.
3. Scale vs. Margin: Markets like the USA ($32.5M Gross Margin) and South Korea ($17.6M Gross Margin) highlighted the importance of market scale in driving significant absolute profit, even if their percentage margin was not the highest.

**2.** Quarterly & Trend Analysis (FY 2019-2021)
1. India GM% Fluctuation: The India sub-zone showed a significant decline in its average GM%, falling from 42.4% in FY 2019 to 32.0% in FY 2021. This substantial 10% drop warrants investigation into cost pressures or competitive pricing.

**Next Steps & Recommendations**
1. Investigate the 10% decline in the India sub-zone's GM% to pinpoint the primary drivers (e.g., changes in COGS, logistics, or pricing strategies).
2. Analyze the high-margin markets (New Zealand, Japan) to identify best practices that could potentially be applied to lower-margin regions.
